FAQ

Q: How does the magic happen?

A: Easy. There's a new service `menu_manipulator.menu_tree_manipulators`
  that is used to apply filters upon Menu Trees before rendering.

  We have created a custom method to automatically filter by language.
  
  You can find code example in `menu_manipulator.module` file.
